Example Bubble Sort in C â€“ 1
Method 2
The above code isnâ€™t optimized for if the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

Even if the array is sorted in the above (method 1) code the time complexity for the best case will still be O(N2).

This can be resolved using a flag variable that changes its value if there was no swapping in any of the passes.
This reduces the best case time complexity (when the array is already sorted) to O(N)
For example -
arr[]  = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
This array is already sorted still the above bubble sort code will run all the passes and iterations anyways.

arr[]  = {10, 20, 30, 100, 50}
Even for this array which has one single item '100' out of place will get sorted in the first pass itself. Still, all passes and iterations will run.

This can be resolved by changing the code as below by introducing a flag variable

Code Method 2
If there is any pass where no swap happens, do not implement any further passes since the array is already sorted.

Run
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *var1, int *var2) 
{ 
    int temp = *var1; 
    *var1 = *var2; 
    *var2 = temp; 
} 

// Here we are implementing bubbleSort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    int i, j; 
    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
        // initializing swapped to 0 (no swaps happenned yet)
        int swapped = 0;

       // Since, after each iteration righmost i elements are sorted   
        for (j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) { 
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) 
            {
                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j+1]);
                // change swap value as swap has happenned
                swapped = 1;
            }
        }
        // if no swaps happen stop don't impliment further passes/iterations
        if(!swapped)
            break;
    }
} 

/* Function to print array */
void display(int arr[], int size) 
{ 
    int i; 
    for (i=0; i < size; i++) 
        printf("%d ", arr[i]); 
    printf("\n"); 
} 

// Main function to run the program
int main() 
{ 
    int array[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; 
    int size = sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]); 

    printf("Before bubble sort: \n");
    display(array, size); 

    bubbleSort(array, size);

    printf("After bubble sort: \n"); 
    display(array, size); 
    return 0; 
}
Output
Before bubble sort: 
10 20 30 40 50 
After bubble sort: 
10 20 30 40 50
Performance-Based Analysis of Bubble Sort Algorithm
Pros
Easy to implement
Cool to implement
Gives the largest value of the array in the first iteration itself.
Or the smallest value of array in the first iteration itself (Minor tweak in implementation)
No demand for large amounts of memory for operation
Cons
Noob (Bad) algorithm ðŸ˜€
Very horrible time complexity of O(n2)
Interesting Facts
Average and worst-case time complexity: o(n2)
Best case time complexity: n when the array is already sorted.
Worst case: when the array is reverse sorted.
Number of comparisons in Bubble sort is reduces by 1 in each pass.

Example â€“ For array size 5, 

In Pass 1: 4 comparisons
In Pass 2: 3 comparisons
In Pass 3: 2 comparisons
In Pass 4: 1 comparison
Thus, for n sized array the total number of comparisons, therefore, is (n â€“ 1) + (n â€“ 2)â€¦(2) + (1) = n(n â€“ 1)/2
